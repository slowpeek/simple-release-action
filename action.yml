      This list is merged into 'dist' so there is no need in mentioning
      the same file in both places.
    required: true
    default: ''

    description: >
      If disabled, 'versioned' files would be included in release
      unmodified as if they were listed in 'dist' instead.
    required: true
    default: yes

    description: >
      If enabled, a commit will be pushed to the repository with
      'versioned' files having their version set to current tag with

  do-docs:
    description: >
      If enabled, some well known docs like README and CHANGELOG are
      included in release. It works with docs in 'org' and 'md'
